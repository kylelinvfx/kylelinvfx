### Hi! 👋 
I am a Houdini FX artist from Taiwan. I enjoy creating FX simulations and tools for creative solutions or 
speeding up the pipeline. Here is the [***link to my website***](https://kylelinvfx.com) to view more of my work.

## About Me

- 💼 Interned at SideFX as an Education and Training Intern in the summer of 2023.
- 🏠 Currently live in Los Angeles.

I am currently working on moving my tools from my personal Google Drive to Github.
I am still learning and setting up everything, so please visit my website to view my works for the mean time and come back later. 
Thank you!
