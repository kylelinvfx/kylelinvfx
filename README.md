### Hi! 👋 
I am a Houdini FX artist from Taiwan. I enjoy creating FX simulations and tools for creative solution or 
speeding up the pipeline. Here is the [***link to my website***](https://kylelinvfx.com) to view more of my work.

## About Me
- 📕 Graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design at June 2023.
- 💼 Interned at SideFX as a Education and Training Intern until the end of last year.
- 🏠 Currently live in Savannah helping some friends with their senior projects as FX TD.
- ✉️ Feel free to email me if you have any questions at ***kylelinvfx@gmail.com***
- 👀 I am also currently looking for work~


I am currently working on moving my tools from my personal Google Drive to Github.
I am still learning and setting up everything, so please visit my website to view my works for the mean time and come back later. 
Thank you!
